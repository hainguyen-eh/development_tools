=begin
  This gem is built on top of Rubocop but takes it further.
  It picks a single style that is not up for debate.
  The idea is that it removes all style conversations
  so you can focus on the functionality.

  # 3. Linters

  # 4. Live tools
=begin
  A very useful gem from Github for larger refactoring.
  It makes it easy to deploy two codepaths side by side and
  effectively verify the correctness of the new codepath
  by comparing its results in production with the old codepath.
